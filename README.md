Microsoft Hackathon project 
A Web-Based VR Social Simulator 


ABA has had success with equipping individuals with ASD with social skills that enable them to live a happier lifestyle
However, individuals may struggle with compound emotions and responding appropriately to different degrees of emotions

Target:
Verbal children on the higher-functioning end of ASD
Build a repertoire of virtual social scenarios for the child to practice applying their social skills
Behavioural analysts can supervise the child’s use of the device and come up with potential scenarios and appropriate responses

How it works:
Virtual person tells user something that has happened
User selects appropriate response to virtual person
Responses that are more appropriate will earn the user more points
Accumulated points can be used to earn rewards for the user

Future additions:
Facial expressions
Body language
User’s physical interaction with virtual environment (hugging the person, giving them something)
Involving family members in scenarios, crowdsourcing
