ABA ([Applied Behavior Analysis](https://autismcanada.org/living-with-autism/treatments/non-medical/behavioural/aba/)) has had success with equipping individuals with ASD ([Autism Spectrum Disorder](https://autismcanada.org/living-with-autism/treatments/non-medical/behavioural/aba/)) with social skills that enable them to live a happier lifestyle
However, individuals may struggle with compound emotions and responding appropriately to different degrees of emotions. Our web-based VR simulation, Emodemy, aims to address that.

## Target:
* Verbal children on the higher-functioning end of ASD
* Build a repertoire of virtual social scenarios for the child to practice applying their social skills
* Behavioural analysts can supervise the child’s use of the device and come up with potential scenarios and appropriate responses

## How it works:
* Virtual person tells user something that has happened
* User selects appropriate response to virtual person
* Responses that are more appropriate will earn the user more points
* Accumulated points can be used to earn rewards for the user

## Future additions:
* Facial expressions
* Body language
* User’s physical interaction with virtual environment (hugging the person, giving them something)
* Involving family members in scenarios, crowdsourcing
